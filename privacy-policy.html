<h1>Misu Bala Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Misu Bala Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the Misu Bala mobile application ("App") is provided by [BOYO LIFESTYLE (pty) Ltd].

1. Information We Do Not Collect

The Misu Bala App is designed to analyze objects (such as fruits) using images captured by the device's camera.

We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Specifically, we do not collect:

Your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.

Your location data.

Any contact information from your device.

Any unique device identifiers for tracking purposes.

Any images or data captured by the camera after the analysis is complete.

2. Permissions Used by the App

Camera (android.permission.CAMERA)

The App requires access to your device's camera for its core functionality:

Purpose of use: To capture a photo of an object (like a fruit).

Data handling: The captured image is immediately converted into a digital format (Base64) and sent to the Gemini API for analysis (object identification and condition assessment). The image is not stored permanently on the developer's servers or locally in the application after the analysis request is completed.

User Control: Camera access is only initiated when the user explicitly presses the "Capture Object for Analysis" button.

3. Third-Party Services

The App relies on the Gemini API for image analysis. When you submit an image for analysis, the image data and a text prompt are sent to this service. The data handling by this third-party service is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.

4. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the "Last Updated" date.
